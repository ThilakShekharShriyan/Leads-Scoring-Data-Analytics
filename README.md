# Leads-Scoring-Data-Analytics

In this Project, we aim to find the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. We are building a model wherein we assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.
We are building a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and is more likely to not get converted.
